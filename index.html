                        <h3>Importance of Agriculture</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock. It includes the preparation of plant and animal products for people to use and distribute to markets.Agriculture provides most of the world's food and fabrics. Cotton, wool, and leather are all agricultural products. Agriculture also provides material for construction and paper products.These products, as well as the agricultural methods used, may vary from one part of the world to another.</p><br>
                        <p>Agricultural methods often vary widely around the world, depending on climate, terrain, traditions, and available technology.Low-technology farming involves permanent crops: food grown on land that is not replanted after each harvest. Citrus trees and coffee plants are examples of permanent crops. Higher-technology farming involves crop rotation, which requires knowledge of farmable land. Scholars and engineers not only use crop rotation and irrigation, but plant crops according to the season, type of soil, and amount of water needed.In coastal West Africa, farmers, usually women, plant corn soon after the first rains of the growing season. They often use an ancient method of clearing called slash-and-burn. First, the farmer cuts all the brush in her plot. When this vegetation dries, she sets fire to it. The heat from the fire makes the soil easy to turn, and the burned vegetation fertilizes it. The farmer then sows kernels of corn saved from the previous year's harvest.Between rows of corn, the African farmer plants other staple crops: legumes, such as peas, or root vegetables, such as yams. This practice of growing several crops in the same plot is called intercropping. By covering most of the ground with vegetation, intercropping prevents moisture loss and soil erosion from seasonal rains.Rain supplies water for the growing plants. The farmer weeds her plot with a hoe. At harvest time, she and her family pick the corn, husk it, and spread the ears in the sun to dry. They grind the dried corn to make porridge.</p>

                        <h3>Why crops are infected?</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Viruses: Viruses are intracellular (inside the cells) pathogenic particles that infect other living organisms. They live off the host's nutrients.</p></li>
                            <li>Bacteria: Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled prokaryotic organisms that reproduce asexually by binary fission (one cell splitting into two). Phytoplasmas are a certain type of bacteria that lack a cell wall.</li>
                            <li>Fungi and Fungal-Like Organisms: Collectively, fungi and fungal-like organisms (FLOs) cause more plant diseases than any other group of plant pathogens. Fungi and FLOs are heterotrophic (cannot make their own food), eukaryotic organisms that have a filamentous growth habit and which may or may not produce spores.</li>
                            <li>For an infectious disease to develop there must be a susceptible host, a pathogen capable of causing disease, and a favorable environment for pathogen development. Collectively, these three aspects are known as the “Disease Triangle.” If any one of these factors is not present, disease will not develop (See Figure 7). In the case of infectious plant diseases, any practice that favors plant growth and reduces either the amount of pathogen present or its development or activity will result in significantly less disease.</li>
                            <li>A disease cycle takes into account the disease triangle: host, pathogen and environment. The development of visual disease symptoms on a plant requires that the pathogen must (a) come into contact with a susceptible host (referred to as inoculation); (b) gain entrance or penetrate the host through either a wound, a natural opening (stomates, lenticels, hydathodes) or via direct penetration of the host; (c) establish itself within the host; (d) grow and reproduce within or on the host; and ultimately, (e) be able to spread to other susceptible plants (referred to as dissemination). Successful pathogens must also be able to survive prolonged periods of unfavorable environmental conditions in the absence of a susceptible plant host. Collectively, these steps are referred to as the disease cycle (see Figure 8). If this cycle is disrupted, either naturally or via the concerted efforts of a grower, the disease will be less intense or fail to develop. In general, there are five methods used to manage plant diseases. These include use of genetically resistant plants, cultural practices, chemical application, beneficial microorganisms to suppress or counter the activity of the pathogen (known as biological control), and the use of quarantines and other regulatory practices. The collective use of all of these strategies is referred to as Integrated Pest Management.</li>

                        <h3>Importance of weather</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>We shall highlight three aspects of the relationship between climate change and agriculture. First, climate change has a direct bearing on the biology of plant growth. Secondly, any assessment of the impact of climate change on agriculture must consider the interaction between the direct biological effects of climate change on the one hand, and other (often dynamic) aspects of the biosphere and geosphere ­­– such as, for example soil conditions, seed–water–fertiliser–pesticide technologies, plant entomology, and so on – on the other. Thirdly, we must consider the impact of climate change on society and economy, and the ability of existing social and economic institutions, particularly in rural areas, to deal with the challenges posed by global warming. Climate change is poised to have a sharply differentiated effect as between agro-ecological regions, farming systems, and social classes and groups.</p>
